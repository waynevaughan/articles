# How Brains Learn Complex Skills

Carl Hendrick recently wrote "The Architecture of Learning" to debunk one of education's most persistent myths: that complex skills are irreducibly complex. Apparently many educators believe skills like reading, writing, and critical thinking can't be broken into teachable parts.

I didn't know this was a myth anyone believed. It seems so obviously wrong if you understand a little about how brains work.

About 20 years ago, I read *On Intelligence* by Jeff Hawkins, the guy who invented the Palm Pilot. Hawkins wasn't an educator or a cognitive scientist. He was an engineer who became obsessed with understanding how the brain produces intelligence. His ideas changed how I think about learning.

## The Brain as a Prediction Machine

Hawkins proposed a framework called Hierarchical Temporal Memory. He demonstrated that the fundamental unit of intelligence is prediction over time. The neocortex, the part of the brain that does most of your thinking, is organized into hierarchies that are constantly predicting what comes next.

Signals from your senses enter at the bottom of this hierarchy. At the lowest levels, your brain detects simple patterns like edges, colors, and basic shapes. These feed into higher levels, which detect more complex patterns built from the simpler ones. Those feed into still higher levels, and so on.

When you look at an apple, your retina sends signals that your brain processes as circular shapes, red color, certain textures. These low-level patterns combine until eventually the concept "apple" emerges. But that recognition depends entirely on the lower levels doing their jobs first.

Each level of the hierarchy makes predictions based on the structures that have formed below it. You can't recognize "apple" at the top if the lower levels haven't developed reliable pattern detectors for edges, curves, and colors. The system is built from the ground up.

## What's Happening in Your Brain

There are physical processes happening inside your skull when you learn something new. Neurons fire together and strengthen their connections. Myelin wraps around pathways, making signals faster. New synapses form. These are physical structures being built through repeated experience.

If these structures can't form and be reinforced, you can't learn. It's like trying to build muscle without working out. You need repetitive stimulus so the tissue has a reason to adapt.

You can't ask a brain to recognize high-level patterns when the lower-level structures haven't formed yet.

This is why systematic phonics instruction works better than whole language approaches. Whole language asked children's brains to do something they architecturally cannot do: recognize meaning directly from text without first building reliable letter-sound correspondences. The brain needs those foundational structures in place before the higher levels can do their job.

The same principle applies to math, to writing, to scientific reasoning, video games, or any complex skill. The hierarchy has to be built from the bottom up. The structures at each level need to form before the next level can reliably build on them.

## Memory, Not Calculation

Hawkins argued that the brain is fundamentally a memory system, not a calculator. When you recognize a face or understand a sentence, you're pattern-matching against stored experience and predicting what comes next.

This is why learning requires repetition and practice. You're giving your brain enough repeated stimulus to build physical structures. Once those structures have formed, once patterns can be retrieved instantly without conscious effort, the higher levels can build on them.

A child who has to consciously sound out every letter doesn't have cognitive resources left for comprehension. But a child whose decoding is automatic can direct all their attention to meaning.

## Why This Myth Persists

I find it strange that this needs to be argued. But I think the myth persists because the people most embedded in education have absorbed philosophies that feel humane but don't match how brains work. Breaking skills into components feels mechanistic. There's an aesthetic preference for "natural" learning through immersion in rich experiences.

I came to education from technology, not from education schools. I never absorbed those philosophies. To me, understanding how a system actually works is the starting point for designing anything.

Because brains work in predictable ways, we can design experiences that let the physical learning process happen.

## The Opportunity

For too long, education has been driven by authoritative figures with strong opinions and devoted followers. The debates have resembled philosophy or religion more than science.

That's starting to change. AI systems will soon observe in detail how millions of people learn and generate a real picture of what actually works. Instead of being beholden to venerated authorities, we'll have data.

This could be one of the greatest benefits of AI in education. Not replacing teachers, but finally giving us the evidence to know what works.

Even without AI, the neuroscience is clear. Your brain is a hierarchical system that builds complex understanding from physical structures that form through repeated practice. Any approach to education that ignores this is fighting against the architecture of the mind itself.
